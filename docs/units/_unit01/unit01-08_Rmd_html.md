This page shows how a compiled R Markdown file looks like (in fact, all code examples in this course were compiled with R Markdown).

## This is a header

This is an R Markdown document. R Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for creating HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. 
For more details on using R Markdown, see [rmarkdown.rstudio.com](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com){:target="_blank"}.

When you click the **Knit** button in RStudio, a document will be generated which includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks *within* the document.
You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```r
summary(cars)
```

```
##      speed           dist       
##  Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  
##  1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  
##  Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  
##  Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  
##  3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  
##  Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00
```


## This is another header

You can also embed plots, for example:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/rmd_images/rmd_html_out/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot (see below).


## R Markdown source
The above content of this page is the result of an R Markdown file, which looks like this:


``````yaml
