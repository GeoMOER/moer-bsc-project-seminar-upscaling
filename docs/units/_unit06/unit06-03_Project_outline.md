Learn more about the requirements for creating a project outline and for the structure, content, and format of your research project.

<!--more-->

## Content and structure

The project outline should include

* a title, of course,
* the authors,
* an introduction outlining the state of the art, research need and relevance of the expected results in the context of your research question,
* a data section describing the intended data you are planning to use,
* a method section with details on the methods you plan to apply on your data for getting an answer to you research question,
* a discussion section, where you discuss the implications, conclusions, potential limitations and improvements, picking up the story you created in the introduction,
* a timetable with important work packages and milestones you aim to work on for reaching the project goal, and
* references on relevant scientific papers, which have been published in the context of your research question.

<b> Note </b> that the project outline should not exceed two pages. These pages will help the instructors to give feedback on especially the feasibility of your project.

## Getting data

After identifying the research question, a critical step is to find or create appropriate data sets for your modeling workflow. We will provide you with datasets from [Kilimanjaro project](http://85.214.102.111/kili_data/){:target="_blank"}.

Some data source suggestions are:

## Sentinel 2 

Sentinel data will be needed to upscale your plot level data to the landscape scale. You have already learnt how to acquire Sentinel 2 data from unit 3.

##  LiDAR and Hyperspectral data

You can use them to relate your selected species data with structural and spectral remote sensing data. This data is available on strato.

## Published datasets of Kilimanjaro region

[GFBio](https://www.gfbio.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Pangea](https://www.pangaea.de/){:target="_blank"} is an excellent source to search what studies have been done in the Kilimanjaro region and accees different datasets. 
Use 'KiLi: Kilimanjaro Research Group' as a search term to get an overview of all published datasets.

## Other sources

If you wish to understand the influence of other environmental variables you can of course freely search other data sources like e.g. [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/){:target="_blank"}, [SoilGrids](https://soilgrids.org/){:target="_blank"}.


## Assignment
Write your outline, therefore
1. identify your research topic, 
2. follow the steps mentioned above, and
3. upload your pdf until 16 June 2023 23:59 on ILIAS.
