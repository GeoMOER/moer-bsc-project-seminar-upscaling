Latest advances in remote sensing has led the way to the development of hyperspectral sensors which has multiple applications in the field of forestry, geology, agriculture etc.
Hyperspectral remote sensing combines the principles of remote sensing and spectroscopy to generate images consisting of several contiguous bands with relatively narrow bandwidths (5-10 nm).
These narrow bands help scientists and researchers to investigate different properties of materials on the ground.
