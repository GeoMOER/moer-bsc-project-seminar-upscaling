This unit is about learning the essentials of upscaling using machine learning. In machine learning, algorithms are used to fit a model to a dataset through training or learning. 
In this unit, we will explore such models and understand the different steps of upscaling.

## Learning objectives

* understand the basics of upscaling workflow
* revise basics of machine learning
* prepare data for the model
* train the model
* make predictions
* fine tune the model
* validate your model
* understand the results
