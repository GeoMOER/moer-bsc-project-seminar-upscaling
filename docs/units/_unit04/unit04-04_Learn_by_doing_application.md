In this exercise we aim to calculate the Vegetation indices for our study area.
As a start load your prepared Sentinel Data from the previous exercise.

## Vegetation indices 

* Get familiar with different types of vegetation indices - NDVI, EVI etc.
** How are the different indices calculated ?
* Select any 3 vegetation indices and calculate the respective index for the study area. 
* Plot the different VIs to observe the difference. 
* In the NDVI, is it possible to identify water body?
* Save the VIs as TIFF files.
