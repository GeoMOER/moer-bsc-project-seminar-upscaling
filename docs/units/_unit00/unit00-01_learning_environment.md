This course is intended as a blended learning module, although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study only, too.
<!--more-->

Our first course session will talk place in presence. 
Subsequent sessions will be in a hybrid format, meaning that parts of the students may attend the sessions in person 
at the [Department of Environmental Informatics](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/fb19/disciplines/physisch/environmentalinformatics){:target="_blank"} in Marburg,
and the others virtually. The link to the virtual meeting room will be provided be the instructors in the first session and can also be found in Ilias (see below).



## HTML learning environment

Your primary learning environment is this public homepage, which was created on GitHub.
Here you find all learning materials, assignment tasks, and help.
The structure is linear, so just work your way through it. 
Of course you can also jump freely between units, but this is not recommended for beginners.


## Flexible learning with deadlines

You will use the learning material provided in the HTML learning environment(s) for solving the given assignment tasks.
The synchronous sessions will be used for discussing the assignments.

Note that you are flexible in solving your assignment tasks using the material provided in the HTML learning environment (and beyond), 
but the deadlines for submitting your solutions must be met.
For details see the [Deliverables](/moer-mpg-upscaling/unit00/unit00-02_deliverables.html) section.

## Virtual meeting rooms

We will use [Big Blue Button](https://www.uni-marburg.de/en/hrz/services/web-conferences/web-conferencing-with-bigbluebutton){:target="_blank"} as main virtual classroom 
for our synchronous (hybrid) sessions.
The link to our classroom can be found in [Ilias](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2785662&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"}.
Additionally, there are student meeting rooms in our course environment in Ilias, which you can freely use on your own for discussing the assignments.


## Ilias

Ilias is the course space offered by the University of Marburg. 
We will use Ilias mainly for the administration of the course and for providing small static documents.
The link to the Ilias space for this course can be found [here](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_2785662&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"}.
Note that you have to log in with your student account. 
There is also a forum in Ilias, which you can use for getting in touch with your fellow students.

The link for joining our GitHub Classroom can be found in Ilias.
