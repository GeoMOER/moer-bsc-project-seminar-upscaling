## Project description 
Synthesis â€“ Kilimanjaro as an integrated Social-Ecological System. Learn more about the project [here](https://kili-ses.senckenberg.de/){:target="_blank"}.

## What are we aiming for ?

Tropical mountains are a hotspots of biodiversity, cultural and linguistic diveristy but are also face both anthropogenic and climate pressures.Such mountains usually have steep climatic gradients, high diversity of ecosystems and multiple stakeholder groups, thus they provide multiple NCPs, the supply and demand of which then becomes crucial to identify. 

Mount Kilimanjaro is one such unique tropical mountain. Thus in this project, we work on quantitatively desrcibing and integrating the major componenets of Kili- Social Ecogical System and their interlinkages across the landscape.

## What will the course deal with?

In this course, you will get a chance to work with real data and work with methods to upscale biodiversity (and NCPs) from plot level data to landscape level and get an understanding how socio-ecological systems work. 

## Why upscale?

Landscape wide data or upscaled data will help us in understanding different trade offs and synergies between supply and demand of differnet NCPs. 
To understand better about how trade offs and synergies are dealt with, refer to [Manning et al 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0461-7){:target="_blank"}.
