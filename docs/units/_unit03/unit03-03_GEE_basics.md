## What is Google Earth Engine? 
[Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/) is a powerful platform designed for analyzing and visualizing environmental data. 
Imagine you have a supercomputer that can access a huge library of satellite images of Earth taken over the last few decades. This is what Google Earth Engine provides.

## Why GEE is relevant to us?

**Massive Satellite Imagery Database:** Google Earth Engine has a vast collection of satellite images. This database is constantly updated and includes historical data, which is great for observing changes over time.

**Powerful Computing Resources:** You don't need a high-end computer to use it. Google Earth Engine does the heavy lifting on its servers, so you can run complex analyses and algorithms through a web interface without needing powerful hardware.

**Environmental Monitoring and Analysis:** It's widely used for environmental research like tracking deforestation, monitoring water levels in lakes and rivers, observing the melting of glaciers, and analyzing urban development.

**Accessible to Non-Experts:** The platform is designed to be user-friendly, so even if you're not an expert in remote sensing or geographical information systems (GIS), you can still use it. There's a bit of a learning curve, but there are plenty of tutorials to help you get started.

**Collaboration and Sharing:** You can collaborate with others and share your findings. It's a great tool for group projects or research work.

**Real-World Applications:** The data and insights gained from Google Earth Engine can have real-world implications, such as helping to inform policy decisions on climate change or natural resource management.

## Introduction to the GEE code editor

Once you have signed up for an account with GGE, you can now start playing around with satellite data using the [GEE code editor](https://code.earthengine.google.com/).

A very well document guide for working with GEE can be found [here](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides) 

## JavaScripting with GEE

To get started with GEE we need to first learn some basics of JavaScript. 
Following are a few necessary functions we will need, but more and detailed guide can be found (here)[https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/tutorials/tutorial_js_01].
