  <li>Show the content of vector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1</code> (e.g. use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print</code> function or just type the variable name in a separate row).</li>
  <li>Create a second vector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> which contains information on the type of mathematical operation used to derive the five results. Hence this vector should have five entries of values <em>sum</em>, <em>difference</em>,…</li>
  <li>Show the content of vector <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code>.</li>
  <li>Combine the two vectors <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> into a data frame called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df</code>. Each vector should become one column of the data frame so you will end up with a data frame having 5 rows and 2 columns.</li>
  <li>Make sure that the column with the data of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v1</code> is named <em>Results</em> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">v2</code> is named <em>Operation</em>.</li>
  <li>Show the entire content of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">df</code>.</li>
  <li>Show just the entry of the cell in the second row and first column.</li>
</ol>

<p>Save your Rmd file in your course repository, knitr it, update (i.e. commit) your local repository and publish (i.e. push) it to the GitHub classroom. Make sure that the created html file is also part of your GitHub classroom repository.</p>
