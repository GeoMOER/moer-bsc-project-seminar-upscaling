<p class="notice--info">The deadlines for uploading your assignment solutions – both marked and unmarked – to GitHub Classroom is 12:00 o’clock in the night between Monday and Tuesday before the next course session.</p>

<p class="notice--warning">Be aware that it will NOT be sufficient to start working on the assignments the day before the deadline.
It will be necessary to solve a lot of disturbing and time-consuming problems in the programming world.
So start early!!!</p>

<h2 id="moha">MOHA</h2>
<p>Additionally, there will be a marked assignment, which needs to be submitted directly at the end of the respective session in the second half of the semester – the MOHA (Marburg Open Hackathon).
Tasks for the MOHA will be selected from all units.</p>

<h2 id="final-grade">Final grade</h2>
<p>Your final grade will consist of the marked assignments and the MOHA.
You may use the following lines of code for calculating your final grade, for example:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">assignment_1</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">5</span><span class="w">
