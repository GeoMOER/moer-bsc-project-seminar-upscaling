Implement a if-then-else statement which prints “even” if the number provided as variable n is even and which prints “odd” otherwise.   Copy the extended larger/equal/smaller if-then-else statement and include it into a for loop which shows that all three options are actually implemented in a correct manner by iterating over n from a number which is smaller 3, exactly 3 and larger than 3.   Extent a copy of the above loop and modify the loop and if-then-else statement in such a way, that the information on “larger” etc. is not printed on the screen but saved within a vector (i.e. a variable which will hold all three statements in the end). Print the content of this vector after the loop.   Extent a copy of the above modified loop in such a way, that the results are not saved in a vector but a list.
